# rick and morty react

This Sprint explored ReactJS, Function Components, component state, side effects and styling techniques. In your challenge for this Sprint, you will demonstrate proficiency by creating an application that uses ReactJS to consume live data retrieved from the World Wide Web and style that data nicely on the page.

## Instructions

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**


You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your TL and Instructor in your cohort help channel on Slack.


## Description

In this challenge, create a web page that presents a styled list of **characters obtained from an API**. Being able to render out data to a web page is a large part of what JavaScript developers do, this challenge assesses your ability to achieve such a task.


## Project Set Up

Follow these steps to set up and work on your project:

- [ ] Create a forked copy of this project.
- [ ] Add TL as collaborator on Github.
- [ ] Clone your OWN version of Repo.
- [ ] Change directories and run `npm install` to retrieve all needed dependencies.
- [ ] Once you have installed the _node_modules_, run `npm start` to get your server up and running.
- [ ] With the server up and running, open Chrome and head over to `localhost:3000` and view your beautiful app. Maybe it's not _that_ pretty... _yet_, your goal is to ensure this project becomes a thing of beauty.
Follow these steps for completing your project.
- [ ] Push commits: `git push origin <firstName-lastName>`.

Follow these steps for completing your project:

- [ ] Submit a Pull-Request to merge <firstName-lastName> Branch into master (student's  Repo).

## Tasks

- [ ] Please refer to the Trello board to see each of your tasks!


### Best style practices

- [ ] Consistent naming. Examples: variables, functions, Components, and file/folder organization.
- [ ] Consistent spacing. Examples: line breaks, around arguments and before/after functions.
- [ ] Consistent quotation usage.
- [ ] Spell-check.
- [ ] Schedule time to review, refine and reassess your work.


### Tips and Gotchas

- [ ] Test your API and inspect the data in Chrome, _before_ writing the code for the request(s). See screenshots at the root of the project.
- [ ] Try not to hammer your API while developing. Infinite loops in your code might trigger hundreds of requests!
- [ ] Running `npm` commands in the wrong folder will not work. **Be aware of what folder you're in** when working in the command line.
- [ ] The `start` process can sometimes choke after adding new dependencies and may need to be restarted.

## Extra Credit (Only do these tasks if you feel comfortable!)

- [ ] Create a search form that will filter through the data displayed from your characters.
- [ ] Build a pagination system that will allow you to load the next page of data.
  - `console.log()` the data coming back from the server.
  - There might be `next` and `previous` fields that give you a URL.
  - You can build a function that will get characters called `getCharacters` that you can use dynamically to get the next or previous set of characters. You would need to supply it with the proper fields, and you'll need to set up more state to do this.
